# Crew Roster

This application seeks to increase sailing opportunities at a yacht or boat club but allowing both skippers and crew to post their interest for given days/times. It's not a reservation system, it just tries to connect people, then they can work out the details.

This is an little holiday project to experiment with serverless applications on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/). As such, it will be making use of AWS services as much as possible. I'm not actually sure how much will actually be stored here in this repository. At minimum, it will have some documentation.

More thoughts on this project in the [design directory](/design/) and [worklog](WORKLOG.md).
